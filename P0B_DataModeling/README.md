# Data Modeling with Cassandra

## A tiny Cassandra cluster

In cluster directory, I have created a tiny Cassandra cluster, made up of vagrant and ansible. I first setup a group of virtual machines equipped with Ubuntu 16.04. Then I use ansible to startup a five-nodes cluster of Cassandra, And I use this to accomplish my project.
